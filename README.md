# Movie-website
A simple movie website made using React, HTML. 
I have used tvMaze api to get movies data.
Includes a basic UI to display the show names and a few details about the movie. Includes a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show in the second page. It also has a button to book a movie ticket which will open a Google form.
